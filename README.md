# Deep learning for hand parts segmentation

## Introduction

This project aims to segment different parts of hands (recognizing different fingers, the palm and wrist).

It uses a UNet trained on artificial hand data generated by [LibHand](http://www.libhand.org/). Its aim is to generalize to images of real hands.
Data are provided in 4 channels: RGB+depth.
